<!-- ## This project is in-progress and not all features have yet been implemented.

###### Try pressing ```s``` on your keyboard to bring up sketch manipulation options.

###### Take a snapshot of the canvas at any time by pressing ```p```.

###### Reload the page at any time to generate a new landscape. Just press ```CMD+R```.

Flocking boids travel through a landscape adhering to three behaviors that define flocking movement.

- Separation:
##### Boids will try to keep away from other boids according to a specified perimeter.
- Alignment:
##### Boids will try to steer towards the average heading of the boids near them.
- Cohesion:
##### Boids will try to steer towards the average heading of the boids near them.

# Sketch Manipulation Descriptions:

- numBoids:
##### Set the maximum number of allowed Boids in the scene. -->
