The Lissajous curve table is a visual representation of harmonic complexity. At each index further into the table the increment is increased resulting in a multitude of unique ratios between row and column circles.

See Worlfram Math World's description of Lissajous curves for further detail [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LissajousCurve.html).

This particle system is [based on an example by The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6iIc6-Y-kk).
