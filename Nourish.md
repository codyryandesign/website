Please email your orders in by Thursday June 6th, for your pick up on June 9th. FYI the salads without being dressed (which is why I serve it on the side) can last a week. So feel free to order more then one on each, and add in the sides/delights and you are set for a work week, a busy home week, busy kid week, a travel week, whatever current moment life is throwing at you.
